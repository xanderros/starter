        In web development, many industries are connected to certain trends. Today, this is relevant in the field of marketing and web design. With the arrival of information technology in our world, there are a lot of changes in the creation of websites. IT technologies are improving every day. And they directly affect what we want to see on the world wide web. After studying the web technologies of 2020, we have determined what tools to use when creating websites in the next year.
      </p>

      <h2>
        Adaptivity
      </h2>

        {{ img('adaptivity', 'jpg', '') }}
      </figure>
      <p>
        Adaptive web design is a page design that provides a convenient and correct representation of the site for the user among the web technologies of 2020. The adaptive web site automatically adjusts to the size of the browser window. The main goal is the universality of the presentation of websites. Site adaptability is the solution of a number of tasks simultaneously, both for the user and for the site owner.
      </p>

      <h2>
        Neural network
      </h2>
      <figure>
        {{ img('neural-network', 'jpg', '') }}
      </figure>
      <p>
        Artificial neural networks are web development in 2020. It is a program that actively implements the neural structures of the human brain. In its simplest form, ANNs mimic the behavior of brain cells. For example, in case of the spam filter of your email, incoming information can be represented by a to-do list that is standard in spam messages, and classification can define the source information for push notifications (determining whether there is spam).
      </p>
      <p>
        Uncontrolled learning in an artificial neural network tries to influence the ANNs through the structure of incoming transmitted information without additional help. Most often, neural networks are created and trained using Python. Therefore, it is necessary to have certain ideas about how to create programs using it.
      </p>

      <h2>
        Single-page applications (SPA)
      </h2>
      <figure>
        {{ img('spa', 'jpg', '') }}
      </figure>
      <p>
        SPA development is gaining popularity by using javascript most often. This is not surprising, since the SPA works perfectly on all devices and demonstrates high performance and development speed. Most developers consider SPA applications to be popular. Analyzing the web technologies of 2019, we can conclude that in 2020, the number of SPAs will grow since most users are increasingly using mobile gadgets.
      </p>

      <h2>
        Chatbots
      </h2>
      <figure>
        {{ img('chatbots', 'jpg', '') }}
      </figure>
      <p>
        Artificial intelligence has allowed chatbots to gain incredible popularity since 2017. Having earned considerable success among web developments in 2019, it does not lose its relevance. We all know the fact when Facebook chatbots entered into a dialogue with one another and invented their own personal language. This extraordinary story confirms that we are gradually entering an age of new transformations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Chatbots created based on artificial intelligence, and neural networks will eventually develop and contribute to improving online communication.
      </p>

      <h2>
        Progressive web applications
      </h2>
      <figure>
        {{ img('pwa', 'jpg', '') }}
      </figure>
      <p>
        Progressive web applications present the list of web technologies in 2020. Google introduced progressive Web Apps in 2015. In the following year, this format of applications began to be used by large sites. PWA is an excellent alternative to mobile applications that are losing their appeal due to the web industry market's glut.
      </p>

      <h2>
        JavaScript and Python
      </h2>
      <figure>
        {{ img('js-and-python', 'jpg', '') }}
      </figure>
      <p>
        In the field of web programming, trends are no less developed. Since 2017, Javascript has been a modern trend in web development. As it continues to evolve, it is a key tool for most web developers. JavaScript-based libraries are becoming more flexible, powerful, and user-friendly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Python is one of the simplest and most popular programming languages. By learning the basic constructs of Python, you can easily solve a wide range of problems. Starting with data analysis and ending with the development and creation of new software products.
      </p>

      <h2>
        Blockchain
      </h2>
      <figure>
        {{ img('blockchain', 'jpg', '') }}
      </figure>
      <p>
        Blockchain and its popularity in the webspace are well-known trends in website development. If you have not yet encountered this concept, we will try to figure out what is what. Blockchain is a method of general storage of information data.
      </p>
      <p>
        The main advantage is the absence of intermediaries between transactions. Blockchain has a high degree of protection. The promise of this technology provides a high degree of cybersecurity. It can confirm the fact that many multinational banks are considering the possibility of implementing Blockchain in their work.

        We are on the wave of global adoption of smart devices. A few years ago, devices were used as fun or entertainment. Now the situation has changed dramatically.  We are on the threshold of the total implementation of IT technologies. With the dynamic growth of mobile users and the introduction of a new algorithm by Google, modern trends in website development are becoming not just a way to increase sales, but a real necessity.
      </p>
      <p>
        The latest trends in web development in 2019 have faded into the background. In the field of web programming, trends are aimed at simplifying user interaction with the app, stimulating customer loyalty and conversion. Pay due attention to all the factors that are disclosed in this article, and make the right decision in web development in 2020.
