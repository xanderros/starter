        Quite often, you can hear the statement that almost any project's success often depends on what project management techniques are applied and how correctly. Over the long period of existence of project management within this industry, many standards and approaches have been developed that are successfully used to manage various projects around the world. And although there is no perfect project management system, there is no way to suit all managers. Many methods have been created for successful application in this direction.

      <h2>
        Digital transformation
      </h2>

      </figure>
      <p>
        This trend has covered virtually all industries and business areas. Project management is no exception. A consequence of digital technologies' penetration is, for example, a gradual reverse shift in the competencies of the project manager from soft skills to hard technical skills. However, soft skills continue to dominate.

      <h2>
        Reducing the role of CIOs in companies
      </h2>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>
        The relationship between business needs and information technology is growing. This requires CIOs to have a deeper understanding of the business and a deeper understanding of IT from functional leaders. With increasing frequency, IT budgets are transferred to the management of representatives of business units. With the development of cloud technologies, mobile applications, and low-code applications, CIOs who are not deeply versed in business will lose credibility among companies' top management.

      <h2>
        Project activities and agile teams
      </h2>

      </figure>
      <p>
        Innovative corporations have begun to switch to a project-based approach to process management - business agility management. It means moving away from rigid organizational structures and line responsibilities in favor of more flexible arrangements that involve temporary teams. Agile teams are assembled for each specific task and can consist of both company specialists and external freelancers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nevertheless, the popularity of hybrid project management practices continues to grow. Despite the hype around agile approaches, they never became the leading methodology in project management. However, thanks to their influence, hybrid practices have outpaced both Agile and DevOps in 2020.

      <h2>
        Kanban method
      </h2>
      <figure>
        {{ img('kanban', 'jpg', '') }}
      </figure>
      <p>
        The Kanban system belongs to the family of agile technologies, so there are no rigid guidelines, principles, or frameworks in it. Like the rest of the family, she is human-centered and maximizes the team's potential.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Kanban philosophy suggests that the project can be improved through the experience gained. According to the methodology, team members analyze the work being done and give suggestions for optimization.
      </p>

      <h2>
        Artificial Intelligence
      </h2>
      <figure>
        {{ img('artificial-intelligence', 'jpg', '') }}

      <p>
        Artificial intelligence, machine learning, and process robotization are changing how we manage projects today and will have an even more significant impact tomorrow.
      </p>
      <p>
        The use of machine learning is in the very early stages of using it for project management. However, 31% of organizations are already using machine learning, and 69% expect a high or moderate impact of this technology in the future. Machine learning is at the heart of many other AI technologies. For example, machine learning can look at a graph and identify areas where projects can be accelerated.
      </p>
      <p>
        AI can play a crucial role in helping project managers make important decisions. Expert systems that go hand-in-hand with decision management also give project managers expert thinking.
      </p>
      <p>
        By 2030, 80% of the work associated with project management will be eliminated as artificial intelligence takes over their traditional functions - data collection, tracking, analysis, reporting, forecasting, and planning. According to experts, AI has the potential to fundamentally change the way project and portfolio management leaders do their current job, even with the use of certain technologies to support their business goals.
