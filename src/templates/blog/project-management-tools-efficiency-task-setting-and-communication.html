        Project management is about efficiency: allocating resources, evaluating tasks, stimulating the team, meeting deadlines, and reaching the top.
        If you want the project manager to work even better, then there are many programs for various purposes: from time management to dealing with clients. However, the theory does not provide proper knowledge, as practice does. So, what solutions are popular among digital managers?
      </p>

      <h2>
        Jira
      </h2>
      <figure>
        {{ img('jira', 'jpg', '') }}
      </figure>
      <p>
        Originally, Jira is a bug tracker, a system for monitoring software code errors. However, this project management tool is used in many companies.
      </p>

      <h2>
        Asana
      </h2>
      <figure>
        {{ img('asana', 'jpg', '') }}
      </figure>
      <p>
        It is another favorite of programmers. Convenient tags, performance analysis, and managing multiple projects within a single team.
      </p>
      <p>
        Intuitive interface. The product features are expanded by connecting third-party services: from Dropbox and Google Drive to Zapier and Bitbucket.
      </p>

      <h2>
        ActiveCollab
      </h2>
      <figure>
        {{ img('active-collab', 'jpg', '') }}
      </figure>
      <p>
        One of the most convenient online project management services in a team. You can set tasks, monitor progress, and upload current expenses and invoices. The software is available in the cloud, but ActiveCollab is also transferred to its own server.
      </p>
      <p>
        It has an advanced filter system, which is useful for a large number of tasks and projects. The system regulates the access of employees and clients to data, as well as stores activity logs.
      </p>

      <h2>
        Slack
      </h2>
      <figure>
        {{ img('slack', 'jpg', '') }}
      </figure>
      <p>
        Today, this is actually the standard for corporate correspondence. Here, employees organize themselves into groups, create threads under each important post, make group calls, and store personal ideas in a private chat. Messenger took the best from its progenitors like IRC and Jabber.
      </p>
      <p>
        A huge advantage of the messenger is the maximum number of integrations with third-party services. The minimalism of the interface does not require serious knowledge. Slack also offers a lot of bots.
      </p>

      <h2>
        Wrike
      </h2>
      <figure>
        {{ img('wrike', 'jpg', '') }}
      </figure>
      <p>
        It is often used to set up content production. Wrike helps you work with files in real-time, implements the Gantt chart perfectly, and has a decent visualization. Wrike also monitors time and budget and provides reports. The workflow itself is divided into categories, projects, tasks, and subtasks. Discussion is linked to issues. In addition to Outlook and Apple Mail, you can create tasks directly from emails.
      </p>
      <p>
        Easy navigation and customizable design. There is a web client, an app for your phone and PC. Lots of integrations.
      </p>

      <h2>
        MS Project
      </h2>
      <figure>
        {{ img('ms-project', 'jpg', '') }}
      </figure>
      <p>
        It is an old-timer of the market, which has recently developed an online version. It is very popular with Western users and is almost synonymous with the Gantt chart. It allows you to plan projects, manage resources, create what-if scenarios, and monitor deadlines and progress. It tightly integrates with Microsoft Office of the latest versions and SharePoint.
      </p>
      <p>
        Integration with other Microsoft Office programs. Ability to model solutions to problems.
      </p>

      <h2>
        Evernote
      </h2>
      <figure>
        {{ img('evernote', 'jpg', '') }}
      </figure>
      <p>
        It is one of the flagship services of the "new wave" (after Microsoft and Web 2.0, of course) for collecting data in teams. It is also a rudimentary administration system that is just beginning to appear in the product. Functions for teams include Task Manager, the Spaces work project system, and creating a corporate knowledge base.
      </p>

      <h2>
        Trello
      </h2>
      <figure>
        {{ img('trello', 'jpg', '') }}
      </figure>
      <p>
        This service is a real popularizer of the Kanban board. It is exceptionally intuitive and simple, allows you to set priorities and integrate with other services. Simplicity is compensated by the flexibility of working with the system. Here you plan tasks, distribute them by stages, and communicate with colleagues.
      </p>
      <p>
        The main advantage is the ability to quickly and easily see the project and visually assess the degree of readiness. There is also a low entry threshold and easy start of projects in minutes.
      </p>

      <h2>
        Basecamp
      </h2>
      <figure>
        {{ img('basecamp', 'jpg', '') }}
      </figure>
      <p>
        It is one of the pioneers of new wave project management systems, launched in 2004. Features include maintaining lists, viewing employee and team schedules, storing files, and group chat. You can use the API to connect third-party applications.
      </p>
      <p>
        The project has retained its functional simplicity, developed a mobile version, and created a convenient calendar of events.
      </p>

      <h2>
        Basecamp
      </h2>
      <p>
        Any project can be managed using a bundle of specialized software. Calendars, task managers, solutions for storing code, graphics, texts, and cloud services for working together on a task â€“ there are really many high-quality solutions.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, all this is only an auxiliary tool. If you want to be a real project manager and not fail your first task, you need a long and painful practice.
