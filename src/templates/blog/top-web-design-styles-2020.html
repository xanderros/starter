        Modern website design is a fairly broad concept, and the whole point of the designer's work is to present information by visual means in such a way as to attract a visitor to the site page and make it a regular user from a simple passer-by.
      </p>

      <h2>Basic requirements of modern web design</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Intuitive graphic design of the site;
        </li>
        <li>
          Development of intuitive navigation (visual structure);
        </li>
        <li>
          The formation of the simple logic of the site;
        </li>
        <li>
          Comfort of user interaction with the site.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The style of a modern website should correspond to current trends in the development of web design. Constantly developing technologies and an increasing number of mobile users dictate compliance with certain rules for modern websites.
      </p>

      <h2>
        Flat design
      </h2>
      <figure>
        {{ img('flat-design', 'jpg', '') }}
      </figure>
      <p>
        Flat design is based on a two-dimensional style. An important visual role is played by colored backgrounds, graphic elements without shadows, textures and other effects that give depth. The use of photos is kept to a minimum.
      </p>
      <p>
        Typical features in web design:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Two-dimensional graphics;
        </li>
        <li>
          Minimum of photos;
        </li>
        <li>
          Contrasting color solutions;
        </li>
        <li>
          Single-color backgrounds that differentiate content.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>
        Promo design
      </h2>
      <figure>
        {{ img('promo-design', 'jpg', '') }}
      </figure>
      <p>
        In promo design, it is important to show the product (service, event, etc.) favorably. The main role is given to photos. They are high-quality, bright, delicious, and often placed on the screen width. Collages and filters for photos are welcome. Large fonts are used in headings, and unusual typography is used.
      </p>
      <p>
        Typical features in web design:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Large photos and videos;
        </li>
        <li>
          Lots of free space;
        </li>
        <li>
          Emphasis of selected elements;
        </li>
        <li>
          Big headlines.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>
        Minimalism
      </h2>
      <figure>
        {{ img('minimalism', 'jpg', '') }}
      </figure>
      <p>
        The main sites in the style of minimalism dictate simplicity and no excess. The amount of visual design is kept to a minimum. Text blocks are compressed to keywords or a call to action. The site should look light and airy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Typical features in web design:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Simplicity and clarity;
        </li>
        <li>
          Lots of free space;
        </li>
        <li>
          Minimum of graphic elements and photos;
        </li>
        <li>
          2-3 colors are used;
        </li>
        <li>
          Ability to focus on typography and large fonts.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>
        Illustration
      </h2>
      <figure>
        {{ img('illustration', 'jpg', '') }}
      </figure>
      <p>
        The main role is given to illustrations: vector drawings are used in backgrounds, icons, and hints. However, you can also use processed photos and cut objects that can be animated. This style is the most expensive both in time and financially. After all, not all designers know how to draw and work with images.
      </p>
      <p>
        Typical features in web design:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Vector illustrations;
        </li>
        <li>
          Two-dimensional graphics;
        </li>
        <li>
          Minimum of photos;
        </li>
        <li>
          Contrasting color solutions.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>
        Grunge
      </h2>
      <figure>
        {{ img('grunge', 'jpg', '') }}
      </figure>
      <p>
        Grunge is characterized by blurry lines, scuffs, and sloppy, worn-out background textures. The color scheme is usually muted, not bright. We welcome the use of decorative manuscript fonts. This contributes to an unbelievable style.
      </p>
      <p>
        Typical features in web design:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Decorative fonts;
        </li>
        <li>
          Frayed textures;
        </li>
        <li>
          Muted, dark color scheme;
        </li>
        <li>
          Decorative elements in the form of scuffs, paint, streaks;
        </li>
        <li>
          Realistic details mostly used: blots, metal, brick, aged wood.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>
        Futurism
      </h2>
      <figure>
        {{ img('futurism', 'jpg', '') }}
      </figure>
      <p>
        In futurism, design elements are associated with the future, space: neon letters on a dark background, large graphics, spacious pages, etc. The style is suitable for image sites and presentations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Typical features in web design:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Large fonts;
        </li>
        <li>
          Dark background;
        </li>
        <li>
          Muted, dark color scheme;
        </li>
        <li>
          Glowing, glittering elements;
        </li>
        <li>
          Lots of free space;

          Volume graphics;
        </li>
        <li>
          Vintage.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This style is characterized by a combination of grace, austerity, and aristocracy. This style also elaborates on decor, decorations such as monograms, frames. Patterns on backgrounds are allowed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Typical features in web design:
      </p>

        <li>
          Textures, patterns;
        </li>
        <li>
          The lack of bright photo, images processed in B&W or vintage style;

        <li>
          Pastel colors.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>
        5 more ideas for finding a style
      </h2>
      <figure>
        {{ img('finding-style', 'jpg', '') }}
      </figure>
      <p>
        To find original solutions, sometimes you need to observe other people's work and learn from their experience. In what areas of design can you find inspiration for creating "author's handwriting"?
      </p>
      <h3>
        1. Typography
      </h3>
      <p>
        The importance of typography has been proven many times. With fonts, it is possible not only to transmit text information but also to create stylish solutions. Web designers work exclusively with typography and use text to create a minimalistic and original design.
      </p>
      <h3>
        2. Navigation
      </h3>
      <p>
        Vertical scrolling is familiar to users, but some designers manage to change the template navigation and apply creative solutions, for example, 360-degree navigation. Navigation changes can also become a feature of a web designer and part of their author's style.
      </p>
      <h3>
        3. Composition
      </h3>
      <p>
        You can also make the layout of elements on the page unusual. The non-standard composition is a distinctive feature of many designers, and you can also use it as a feature of the author's projects.
      </p>
      <h3>
        4. Illustrations
      </h3>
      <p>
        Original illustrations can make the project truly unique. Illustrators are especially valued in web design as they create unique works.
      </p>
      <h3>
        5. Color scheme
      </h3>
      <p>
        The selected shades of colors can also become the author's idea and distinguish the project from the rest. Searching for non-standard combinations, combining pastel tones and bright accents, using contrasting images - all this will help you find a highlight in your work and create a unique author's style.
      </p>
      <p>
        Often, designers do not attach much importance to finding their own style and creating projects by copying other people's work or using one of the existing directions' basic principles. However, this approach does not allow the designer to express themselves creatively and become the best in their field. On the other hand, designers are too attached to the created concept - they use the same colors, do all projects with vintage patterns, and so on. Therefore, it is important to search constantly, even if your own idea of the ideal project has been formed.
