      </h2>
      <figure>
        {{ img('micro-animation', 'jpg', '') }}
      </figure>

        {{ img('responsive-design', 'jpg', '') }}
      </figure>
      <p>
        Mobile traffic grows more and more every year. In many countries, it has already exceeded the volume of desktop traffic. Therefore, it is worth paying due attention to responsive web design. It will make your brand stand out in terms of professionalism and attention to detail.
      </p>

      <h2>
        7. Scalable vector graphics
      </h2>

        {{ img('vector-graphics', 'jpg', '') }}
      </figure>
      <p>
        This 2020 web design & development trend is geared towards mobile users too. Both attractive multimedia content (video or gif) and static PNG significantly slow down page loading from a mobile device. The SVG format came to the rescue. It has a relatively small size and is scalable indefinitely, so the graphics do not lose the quality even on high-resolution screens.
      </p>

      <h2>
        8. Voice interfaces
      </h2>
      <figure>
        {{ img('voice-interfaces', 'jpg', '') }}
      </figure>
      <p>
        Users of devices that carry smart virtual assistants have long preferred to interact with them and search for something on the Internet using their voice. This is because speaking directly to the device is much more convenient than typing requests manually. And if web developers adapt their interfaces for voice interaction, they can catch a more involved audience's attention.
      </p>

      <h2>
        9. Gamification and storytelling
      </h2>
      <figure>
        {{ img('gamification', 'jpg', '') }}
      </figure>
      <p>
        Gamification is the process of adding game elements to non-game products and services. It helps to stimulate user behavior. For example, filling out a profile, increasing page views, adding reviews, etc. Storytelling is a story in design that helps the user interact with website usability as easily as possible and understand the product.
      </p>

      <h2>
        10. Design systems
      </h2>
      <figure>
        {{ img('design-systems', 'jpg', '') }}
      </figure>
      <p>
        A design system is a guideline with a set of brand values, tools and components that makes it easier to create, test, visually and technically update products and ensure consistency in their interfaces. The popularity of design systems will continue to grow.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most often, they are used by large companies, mainly banks. Organizations communicate with clients in various ways: using a website, a mobile application, emails, printing products, etc. This is where the design system comes to the rescue, a unified approach to the mobile friendly website design	 and design of advertising products.
      </p>
      <p>
        This method saves time and minimizes the chance of error. A common UX UI web design approach makes the product more understandable for customers and simplifies the user's life. Besides, a consistent visual style makes the brand more recognizable.
