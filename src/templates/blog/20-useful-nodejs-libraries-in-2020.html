        Node.js is a software platform that makes JavaScript a general-purpose language. It is also called the JS
        runtime. It can communicate with the external libraries, invoke commands from code, and act as a web server.
        This tool adds a back-end part to the full front-end language, allowing you to create websites and full-fledged
        applications without using a browser.
      </p>
      <p>
        Like JavaScript, Node runs in V8. It is a runtime environment that translates what a web developer writes into
        machine code â€” a set of direct instructions for the computer that do not require interpretation. It makes the
        low-level code fast and easy for the machine to recognize.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today we will talk about useful packages for Node.js:
      </p>

      <h2>1. Express</h2>

        {{ img('expressJS', 'jpg', 'Express JS') }}
      </figure>
      <p>

      <p>
        Multer is an intermediate layer software for Express that is designed for processing multipart/form-data. These
        data are mostly sent to the server when files are uploaded. Note that this library does not process data which
        type differs from multipart/form-data.
      </p>

        following tasks:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Crawling arrays, objects, and strings;

      </p>

      <h2>Main advantages of Node.js</h2>
      <p>
        One of the most important advantages of the platform is asynchrony, combined with an event-based approach.
        Unlike streaming, event-oriented programming is based on some external actions. The program execution depends on
        the user's actions or the network package received by the program, and so on.
      </p>
      <p>
        This solution makes it easier to program interactive applications based on I/O. These can be online chats or
        game apps, colorful interactive web services, or all sorts of calculators, ratings, voting, etc.
      </p>
      <p>You can talk about extensions for Note and libraries for a very long time. The number of ready-made modules and
        various solutions is growing every day. Today, it's hard to find an interactive web project that doesn't use
        Note. Therefore, if you want to engage in web development, be sure to pay attention to this tool.</p>
